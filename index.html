            <p>Hello, my name is Aaron Davis and welcome to my portfolio.</p>
            <p>My journey to becoming the Digital Media Expert and aspiring Web Developer I am now has been unorthodox to say the least, 
              but an advantageous experience I would welcome all over again.</p>

            <p>My professional career began in the financial industry. Working for companies such as Fidelity and TD Ameritrade, 
              I had my sights on becoming a trader and active player in the stock market. During this time I was able to acquire a great foundation of skills 
              such as Team Building, People Management, and Client and Account Management. Unfortunately, due to the downturn of the economy
              at the time and the volativity of the industry as a whole I began to realize that the financial industry was not going to be something
              that interested me in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>After a couple of years supporting software developers and an gaining hands on experience with SQL, shell, and perl scripting
              languages I received a great opportunity with iProspect. At iProspect I was able to work with large sets of data while 
              managing product feeds for large scale retailers like Staples, Adidas and Luxottica brands Oakley, Ray-Ban, and Sunglass Hut. 
            </p>

            <p>Managing product feeds and the back end of Shopping Campaigns and CSEs quickly fed my desire to learn more about digital media.
              It was not long before I was managing not only the product feeds, but the front end of Shopping Campaigns and Search Ads in Google AdWords.
              I continued to add other channels like SEO and Social Media to my skills and knowledge during my time at Elite SEM volunteering clients outside of E-commerce.
            </p>

            <p>My desire to learn more about digital media expanded further into development. As a marketer I realized how much help so many
              clients needed from a web development/SEO standpoint. Many clients were facing deficiencies in development that could not be corrected
              or improved by digital media campaigns. I realized just how important it was from a digital marketers standpoint to know and understand web
              development technologies. 
            </p>

            <p>Even as a child I had a strong desire to learn web development. I already had a strong self-taught understanding of HTML and CSS. It was early 2018,
              that I realized in order for me to make the next step in my career I wanted to add Full Stack Development to my list of skills. So I enrolled in SMU Part-Time
              Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. This portfolio will be updated as I progress throughout the course. I committed myself to this program in order to fulfill 
              both my personal and professional goals. I look forward to successful completion of the program near the end of 2018.
